# About Me

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! Here’s a bit about me:

At heart, I’m a problem-solver, but by trade, I’m a software

developer and project manager based in Chicago, IL. My journey into

tech kicked off with a coding bootcamp during the pandemic, but

before that adventure, I spent many years in account management. I

began my tech career as a developer, but I soon discovered my true

passion lies in project management—a role that lets me combine my

problem-solving skills with my love for collaboration. My years in

account management taught me how to build strong client

relationships, while my hands-on experience as a developer helps me

bridge the gap between technical teams and stakeholders. I’ve earned

my CAPM certification, and I’m currently preparing for the PMP exam

to continue leveling up my skills. As I look ahead, I’m excited to

keep refining my expertise and tackling new challenges in this

dynamic, ever-evolving field
