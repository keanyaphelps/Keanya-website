# About Me

Welcome to my little corner of the internet.

I’m a Chicago-based software developer turned project manager and, at heart, a lifelong problem-solver. I began my tech journey during the pandemic through a coding bootcamp after years in account management. While I started as a developer, I quickly discovered that project management is where I thrive, blending technical insight, collaboration, and strategic thinking.

My background in client relationships, combined with hands-on development experience, allows me to bridge the gap between technical teams and stakeholders. I hold my CAPM certification, and I’m currently preparing for the PMP as I continue leveling up in this ever-evolving field.

## Background

Before tech, I spent over a decade in client-facing roles across finance and insurance, work that taught me how to navigate high-stakes conversations, manage risk, and build trust over time.

During the pandemic, I made the leap into software through an intensive full-stack boot-camp and started my career as a developer. That hands-on engineering foundation still shapes how I lead today: I understand the realities of delivery, the tradeoffs teams make, and what it takes to ship quality work.

Today, I serve as a Technical Project Manager at Caktus Group, supporting mission-driven teams as they build robust, data-driven Django applications. I feel most at home where clarity, people, and systems converge. I help teams transform complexity into forward motion.
